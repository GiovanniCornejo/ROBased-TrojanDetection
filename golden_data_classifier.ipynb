    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview of Training with Golden Data\n",
    "\n",
    "One method of hardware Trojan detection involves monitoring changes in the frequencies of *ring oscillators* (ROs) on the chip, which can reveal anomalies in power consumption indicative of Trojan activity. In this notebook, the classifier is trained using only data from *golden* (Trojan-free) chips, making it necessary to establsh a reliable baseline of normal behavior without direct examples of Trojan-related deviations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenges and Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary challenge is to accurately detect Trojans using a classifier trained solely on golden data. This approach presents several difficulties:\n",
    "* **No Trojan-Specific Training Data**: The classifier must learn normal behavior from golden chips alone, relying on subtle deviations from this norm to identify Trojans\n",
    "* **Natural Variation in Chips**: Manufacturing differences cause natural variations in RO frequencies even among Trojan-free chips, complicating the definition of normal.\n",
    "* **Subtle Trojan Impact**: Trojans may induce only slight frequency changes, requiring the classifier to be sensitive enough to detect small anomalies.\n",
    "* **Preference of False Positives Over False Negatives**: False negatives pose a higher security risk than false positives. Therefore, the classifier should err on the side of caution, prioritizing sensitivity to potential anomalies, even if it results in a higher false positive rate."
