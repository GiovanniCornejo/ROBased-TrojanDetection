    "# Classifier Training with Unidentified Data\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook performs the training of a classifier using unidentified samples, with no knowledge about the samples, whether they are golden (clean), Trojan-inserted, or a mixture of both. Since the data is unlabeled, the classifier must learn under uncertain conditions.\n",
